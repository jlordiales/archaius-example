Archaius example
================

This is just a simple application to showcase some of [Archaius](https://github.com/Netflix/archaius) features, including
reading from property files with custom names, use cascade properties, using a custom JDBC source to read properties from
a DB and playing around with JConsole to modify properties in runtime.

The project has a few tags to show the evolution from using the most simple possible configuration to more complex ones.
To see the list of available tags you can do ```git tag``` and ```git show #tagName``` to see more info about any of the
tags listed before.

You can move through these tags to take a look at the different states of the showcase with
```git checkout #tagName``` where #tagName is one of the tags listed with ```git tag```.
